   - Computes **weighted GPAs** to reflect the importance of credit-heavy courses.
   - Displays **pass rates** to provide insights into course difficulty and student performance.

4. **Data Input and Output**: Reads data from external files (`results.txt`, `courses.txt`, `students.txt`) and outputs summary tables for courses and students in a user-friendly format. The output is designed to be clear and informative for both administrators and academic staff.

5. **Error Handling**: Implements custom exceptions to handle file issues, data format errors, and missing information. This ensures that the program runs smoothly and provides informative error messages when issues arise.

## Key Computer Science Concepts
1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: The project demonstrates the core principles of OOPâ€”**encapsulation**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism**. The use of specialized classes such as `CoreCourse`, `ElectiveCourse`, `UndergraduateStudent`, and `PostgraduateStudent` highlights how OOP can be used to model real-world entities and their interactions.

2. **Encapsulation and Abstraction**: Each class encapsulates attributes and methods relevant to a specific entity, like courses or students, making the code modular and easier to maintain. Complex operations like GPA calculation and enrollment checks are abstracted away from the user, ensuring ease of use and a clean interface.

3. **Polymorphism**: Through method overriding, specialized subclasses like `UndergraduateStudent` and `PostgraduateStudent` modify and extend the behavior defined in the `Student` class. This allows for flexible and reusable code that can easily adapt to changes in business logic.

4. **Algorithm Design**: The solution includes algorithms for calculating **GPA**, **pass rate**, and **weighted average scores**. These algorithms ensure efficient processing of student data, provide insightful metrics for academic progress, and identify areas where students might need additional support.

5. **Data Structures**: The project makes extensive use of Python dictionaries and lists to efficiently store and access students and courses based on their unique IDs. This choice of data structure ensures fast lookups and efficient management of the relationships between students and courses.

6. **File Handling**: Python's file handling is used to read and parse data from multiple input files. This makes it easy to work with different datasets, enabling flexibility in testing and updating data without modifying the underlying code.

7. **Error Handling**: Custom exceptions are employed to handle scenarios such as missing data, incorrect file formats, and invalid entries. This robustness is crucial in real-world applications where data quality can vary significantly.

To understand how to use **ScholaFlex**, refer to the sample data files provided in this repository: `courses.txt`, `results.txt`, and `students.txt`.

1. **Display Course Summary**: The course summary includes details about each course, such as the average score, the number of students who completed the course, and the number of ongoing enrollments. This information helps administrators understand course popularity and difficulty.

2. **Student Information**: Analyze individual students' progress by calculating their GPA, tracking completed courses, and generating performance reports. This feature helps academic advisors provide tailored support to students who may need help.

3. **Result Analysis**: Compute overall pass rates, display ongoing versus completed courses, and identify the most challenging subjects based on pass rates. This feature is particularly useful for curriculum planners and instructors to assess course effectiveness.

## Design Decisions
- **Class Hierarchies**: The use of inheritance in the `Student` and `Course` classes allows for specific behaviors for different types of students (undergraduate vs. postgraduate) and courses (core vs. elective). This approach simplifies the code by avoiding repetition and making it easier to extend functionality in the future.

- **File Input**: The decision to use text files (`courses.txt`, `students.txt`, `results.txt`) for data input provides flexibility during development and testing. Users can easily modify data without changing the source code, making it easy to experiment with different scenarios.

- **Method Choices**: Methods like `calculate_gpa()` and `weighted_gpa_4()` were implemented to showcase different ways of handling academic performance metricsâ€”using both a simple 100-point scale and a GPA weighted by course credits. This dual approach provides a more comprehensive view of student performance.

- **Student Enrollment**: Enrollment checks were implemented to ensure students meet the criteria for either full-time or part-time status. This feature reflects real-world administrative policies and helps ensure data integrity.
